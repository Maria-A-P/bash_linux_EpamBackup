# Parameters for backup are set inside 'B-script.sh'
# See notes inside 'B-script.sh'
# Type something like 'nano B-script.sh' in order to read notes and specify the parameters
#   
#==================================================================
#
# All files related to the backup script are located inside directory 'EpamBackup'.
# These include the script itself, logs, auxiliary files, this help file, and archives created by the script.
#
# The directory 'EpamBackup' should be placed either in   '/root/'  or in   '/~/'  (the home directory of a user)
# 
# If the path to 'EpamBackup' directory is  '/root/EpamBackup' 
# then one can choose to backup any files ( ??? except those located inside users' home directories (inside /home) - NO...)  (PROVERIT')
#
# If the path to 'EpamBackup' directory is '/home/u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e/EpamBackup' 
# then files within '/home/u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e/' only can be chosen to be backed-up                               (PROVERIT')
#
# 
# Appropriate rwx rights and ownership for the script file (B-script.sh) (and maybe for the whole folder EpamBackup)
#  should be set by system adminisrator, no check is performed by the script.                           (PROVERIT')
#
#===================================================================
#
# Multiple sets of parameters for the script are allowed 
# (currently they are to be specified inside the script, in a separate section, 
#  and the amount of sets of parameters is currently limited by 3).
# 
# The name of the archive to be created will consist of 
#        the parameters set's number and (short) name, and local and universal dates. 
#
# The name of the set of parameters should not exceed 15 characters,                                 (PROVERIT')
#    may consist of alphanumeric symbols (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and dash (-) only,                        (PROVERIT')
#    and should start with a letter.
#
# The archives are saved inside 'EpamBackup/B-Archives/'.
#
# Directory 'B-Archives'  should not be deleted, copied or renamed.                                           (PROVERIT')
#
# Old archives should be deleted manually (for safety reasons no auto deletion is performed).
#
#===================================================================
#
# Logs:
#
# Settings for all parameters sets get into file B-log.
#
# All errors and error-like messages are saved to B-log-errors 
#
# B-log and B-Log-errors files are generated in EpamBackup directory. 
# B-log and B-Log-errors files should be cleaned off (or deleted) manually as they become quite large.
#
#===================================================================
#
# A user or system administrator must specify the following parameters:
# - the disk space usage (DSU) limit for archives in 'EpamBackup/B-archives/'
#         (if the limit is reached, a message is sent to command line interface and to 'B-log', 
#          but no deletion is performed)                                                            (PROVERIT')
#          ('0' or '' means 'no limit'),
# - the names of directories and separate files to be archived
#           (as described in "Pattern Matching" section of Bash reference manual - e.g. '~/Documents', or '/*')                  
#           A user can choose directories and files inside his home directory only (in case of  '/home/"username"/EpamBackup/'),
#           a system aministrator may choose any (in case of /root/EpamBackup/).
#           Note that the leading '/' is removed from full paths for directories and files as they get into an archive.
#           Also note that any hard or symbolic links are being archived as a full copy of the file they were pointing at.
#           The amount of patterns for directories and separate files paths together is currently limited by 5.
# - the names of directories and files inside the above-mentioned directories that should not be archived       (PROVERIT')
#           (as described in "Pattern Matching" section of Bash reference manual - e.g. '*.mp3', or '~/.??*')                 
#           The amount of patterns for directories and files paths together is currently limited by 5.
# - a compression algorithm                                                                           (PROVERIT')
# - the need for verification of created archives (recommended, but takes time)                       (PROVERIT')
